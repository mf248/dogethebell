<ul>
	<li>How does Taco Bell know people will buy the gift cards?
		<br>They don't.  Taco Bell will know the total amount pledged on the website and how much Dogecoin to expect if everyone follows through.  However, unless someone gives up their anonymity Taco Bell won't know who did not follow through on their pledge.  
		<br>Still, the Doge community is based on goodwill and we expect people to follow through and welcome Taco Bell into the community and to the moon. Also, even if T-Bell doesn't get the full payout, they get plent of publicity generated by the pledgers. </li>
