		<h5>How does Taco Bell know people will buy the gift cards?</h5>

			<p>They don't.  Taco Bell will know the total amount pledged on the website and how much Dogecoin to expect if everyone follows through.  Taco Bell will have an overall picture of what percentage of pledgers actually followed through and a bad percentage may make the community & Dogecoin as a whole look bad.  However, unless someone gives up their anonymity, Taco Bell won't know which individuals did not follow through on their pledge.
			</p>
			<p>Still, the Doge community is based on goodwill and we expect people to follow through and welcome Taco Bell into the community and to the moon. Also, even if T-Bell doesn't get the full payout, they get plent of publicity generated by the pledgers.
